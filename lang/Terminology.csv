"Method, Mathematics and Proper Terminology"
The method/methodology has not been justified through presentation of potential alternatives and resulting justification of the selected method on a balanced and well reasoned basis.
The method/methodology is not well reported and there is insufficient detail and description; the reader should be able to follow the reasoning and development and there should be adequate explanation and illustration in relation to the approach adopted.
Important assumptions have not been addressed/stated.
Fundamental flaws in methodology have been noted.
"Standard and well accepted approaches have not been adopted, without clear justification for avoiding these."
"The presentation of mathematics has clear deficiencies e.g. errors are present; wrong symbols have been used, Greek letters are absent or incorrect, subscripts and/or superscripts are missing; equation layout is flawed."
Important equations/expressions have not been properly numbered in sequence.
Key steps are missing in the development of equations/expressions.
Excessive detail has been included in the development of equations/expressions.
Units or symbols are not consistent with appropriate conventions e.g. such as the SI system of units.
Abbreviations and/or acronyms do not follow normal conventions or have not been explicitly defined at the first mention.

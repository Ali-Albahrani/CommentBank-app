Introductory Material
"There is little or no introductory material and there has been a tendency to dive into the ‘meat’ of the work without preparing the reader, by leading gradually into the subject-matter."
"The scope of the introductory material is inadequate and there is insufficient review of relevant background information which underpins the work being reported; There should be adequate referencing within the introduction to demonstrate relevant wider reading in the relevant areas, cognate with the topic."
One or more major areas of relevance has been overlooked completely or given only trivial coverage within the introductory material.
Irrelevant or inappropriate material has been included in the introductory material.
"The introductory material includes excessive coverage and/or detail in relation to aspects of background material, thereby taking up valuable reporting space required for later sections of the document (i.e. ‘too much book’ and not enough evidence of original work)."
